# DOMtags

## About the project
**DOMtags** are a set of dynamically generated HTML DOM tags created through a series of PHP classes. They are meant for keeping backend code clean in large projects that make use of lots of HTML within the PHP, which can cause unnecessary clutter.

## Development timeline
I will add support for additional tags/parameters as needed/requested.

## Installation
Place the files in a subdirectory of your root installation, such as an `includes` directory. The license and readme may be removed once installed.
